Mission Shakti has two sub-schemes ‘ Sambal ’ and ‘ Samarthya ’. While the “ Sambal ” sub-scheme is for safety and security of women, the “ Samarthya ” sub-scheme is for empowerment of women. Their components are as follows: [A] Sambal – (1) One Stop Centres, (2) Women Help Lines, (3) Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, (4) NariAdalats. [B] Samarthya – (1) Shakti Sadans (homes for women victims of destitution and trafficking), (2) Sakhi Niwas (working women hostels), (3) PMMVY, (4) Palna (creches), (5) NHEW (national, state and district level hubs for empowerment of women).

As stated above, the “ Sambal ” sub-scheme is for safety and security of women. The following are the components of this sub-scheme: • One Stop Centres (OSCs) provide support of temporary shelter, and medical, police, legal and psychological support under one roof. 770 OSCs have been operationalized across the States/UTs. These are proposed to continue. Further, under Mission Shakti, 263 more OSCs will be opened in districts with high rate of crime against women or large geographical area based on the demands from the States/UTs. OSCs have been provided with dedicated vehicles. Most importantly, OSCs, along-with District Hubs for Empowerment of Women, will be developed as the mainstay and the key convergence and coordination points for matters pertaining to women in their respective districts. • Women Helplines are already running on telephonic shortcode181-WHL in 35 States/ UTs. They work in tandem with OSCs and connect to various institutional setups for safety and security of women. Under Mission Shakti, the WHLs will connect to all institutional and statutory, schematic and institutional setups pertaining to women. Their linkages with other helplines will also be strengthened. Most importantly, WHLs, alongwith State Hubs for Empowerment of Women, will be developed as the mainstay and the key convergence and coordination points for matters pertaining to women in their respective States/ UTs. • Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) is the clarion call of our Hon’ble Prime Minister for social, cultural and mindset change for safety, empowerment and dignity of women and girls from a lifecycle continuum perspective. It will be extended from the present 405 districts to all districts of the nation under Mission Shakti. • Nari Adalats will be a new component under the Sambal sub-scheme of Mission Shakti. These will be women’s collectives to promote and facilitate alternative dispute resolution and gender justice in society and within families, taking learnings from their success in Gujarat. .

These will be women’s collectives to promote and facilitate alternative dispute resolution and gender justice in society and within families, taking learnings from their success in Gujarat. . The “ Samarthya '' sub scheme is for empowerment of women. Its components are: • Shakti Sadan s will be the main schematic set up providing homes and institutional support for empowerment of women facing destitution of any kind, including through recovery, rehabilitation, repatriation and reintegration of such women, including women victims of trafficking. The existing schemes of Swadhar Greh (for destitute women) and Ujjawala (for victims and trafficking) will be merged into this component. In addition to continuation of 467 Swadhar and Ujjawala homes as Shakti Sadans, 53 new Shakti Sadans will be set up under Mission Shakti. States will have flexibility to run separate homes or separate accommodations within the same home for trafficked and other destitute women. An new important aspect of this component will be monthly deposit of Rs 500 in bank accounts of women residing in Shakti Sadans, to be given to them on moving out for their self empowerment. • Working Women Hostel s will run as Sakhi Niwas under Mission Shakti, and 50 new hostels will be operationalized under the Mission to run on rental model, responding to demands and locational requirements of working, rather than on building construction. • The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) will now run under Mission Shakti as it pertains at its core to women’s empowerment. It was earlier a part of the Umbrella ICDS Scheme. Its aims will continue to be to provide for wage loss compensation to and to promote health seeking behaviour amongst pregnant and lactating mothers and their newborn. Under Mission Shakti, for enhancing the ease of living of beneficiaries, the number of instalments for release of fund will be brought down from 3 to 2 for the first living childbirth. Further, the benefit of this scheme will now also be provided for the second living childbirth of a girl child, wherein Rs 6 thousand will be given in one instalment after childbirth subject to scheme guidelines. Transfer of funds will be in DBT mode, directly to beneficiaries’ bank accounts. Provision for self-registration by beneficiaries has already been made over UMANG App under PMMVY. • The National Creche Scheme for children of working mothers will run as the component named Palna under Mission Shakti. Most of the creches under this component will run at Anganwadis in order to make the best use of already available governmental resource. However, where there is a demand for a creche and an anganwadi is not there, it will be possible to open standalone creches also. Earlier, this scheme was also under Umbrella ICDS Scheme. However, in view of the key purpose of creches being promoting and facilitating workforce participation of women, besides care of their children, it has now been included in Mission Shakti. • The component called National Hub for Empowerment of Women will have national, state and district level set ups for (i) drilling down the implementation and monitoring of all components of Mission Shakti; (ii) convergence of all schemes and initiatives of central and state governments for enhanced results for empowerment, security and safety of women, (iii) research, publication, gender budgeting etc.; (iv) gap funding for empowerment of women.

The key differences of Mission Shakti from the earlier Umbrella Scheme for Women run by MWCD are as follows: • Mission Shakti has only 2 sub-schemes (namely Sambal and Samarthya), whereas the earlier Umbrella Scheme for Women had 8 sub-schemes (namely, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, One Stop Centres, Universalization of Women Help Lines, Mahila Police Volunteers, Mahila Shakti Kendra, Ujjawala, Swadhar Greh, Working Women Hostels). • There will be clear system of convergence, synergy and optimization-of-resource-usage amongst the various components of Mission Shakti, which was not so well pronounced earlier, resulting in better outcomes. It will also lend greater flexibility amidst the components within a sub-scheme and will go a long way in realizing the motto of maximum governance with minimum government. • National, state and district level hubs for empowerment of women will work in tandem with their counterpart women-related institutional setups at those levels, especially with WHLs at state and OSCs at district levels. This will provide a strong systemic delivery and convergence mechanism to the Mission. • New features such as (1) geo-tagging of field setups, (2) development of a national gender index, with leads for ranking and rewards to states and districts, (3) gap/ flexi funding etc. will be there. • Resource optimization and removal of duplication/ redundancy will also be achieved through measures such as (i) common pool of counsellors across institutional set ups within a district, (ii) capacity enhancement of staff, (iii) common/ shared development of IEC, media and advocacy material, (iv) leveraging the strengths and networks of urban and rural local bodies, anganwadi infrastructure, women’s self help groups, shaurya dals, voluntary organizations (including Nehru Yuva Kendras, Lion, Lioness and Rotary Clubs etc).

The existing scheme of Mahila Police Volunteers (MPV) has been dropped as response of the scheme from many States/ UTs has not been very encouraging, and the evaluation study undertaken by NITI Aayog found that the scheme has a weak institutional mechanism for implementation and delivery. The existing scheme of Mahila Shakti Kendra has been partially subsumed in the National Hub for Empowerment of Women (NHEW), while dropping its component of college student volunteers in blocks of aspirational districts, as the response to this component has not been very encouraging from States/ UTs, also, in part due to infrastructural challenges (pertaining to non-availability of colleges/ college staff in some blocks in aspirational districts).

In addition, there will be a well developed IT system to support and ensure coordinated delivery of the objectives and targets of Mission Shakti. Under the Mission, all relevant parameters or KPIs pertaining to outputs and outcomes will be identified in advance, a national index to capture performances of states and districts will be developed. This will not only help in motivating states and districts to perform better, but will also help sketch the right picture of governmental initiatives for and status of women in the nation. All these will be in addition to the traditional systems of implementation, monitoring and review such as review meetings, video conferences, individual follow ups etc. As already mentioned above, the National Hub for Empowerment of Women will have national, state and district level set ups for drilling down the implementation and monitoring of all components of Mission Shakti, as well as for convergence of all schemes and initiatives of central and state governments for enhanced results for empowerment, security and safety of women and girls at the grassroots.
